<p class="lr"><i>Washington: March, 1809</i></p>
</div>
<p>Suddenly, as he climbed the long, curving flight of
stairs, he knew that now he was an old man.</p>
<p>Sixty-six last April, and, though his sandy red hair
had merely faded instead of turning gray, there were
twinges in his knees that reminded him of too many miles
in the saddle, in cold rain and sleet, too many hours standing
at his writing table, too much tension, not enough
rest. But now he could rest.</p>
<p>In the half-furnished rooms of the White House below,
the crowd still danced at the Inaugural Ball, with the wife
of the new president, sparkling, vivacious Dolly Madison,
a gay and charming hostess in a sweeping white cambric
dress and the inevitable enormous turban on her head.</p>
<p>He was grateful, Thomas Jefferson was thinking as he
toiled up the stairs, that he had been able to see his good
friend, Jemmy Madison, inaugurated president of these new
and struggling United States. But he was even more grateful
that his own years of service were at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No third term,&rdquo; he had told them when they importuned
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
him. &ldquo;No, never! My work is done. I am going
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If only he could have left a government in peace, but, for
this new nation that he had worked a lifetime to build, it
appeared sadly that there could be no peace. Off the coasts
of his country British and French ships prowled and battled,
seizing American shipping, taking off sailors at gunpoint,
confiscating cargoes. Would James Madison be able
to keep the nation out of another war? he worried, as he
entered the disordered bedroom where his half-packed possessions
were strewn about, books stacked on the floor,
papers spread over the bed. Down below in some of the
empty rooms of the mansion were piled other boxes of
papers already sorted and made ready to travel by barge and
wagon back to his &ldquo;Little Mountain&rdquo; in Albemarle County,
his beloved Monticello.</p>
<p>As he closed the door of the room, there was a little
whistle and a whir of wings, and his pet mockingbird came
charging through the air, all reaching feet and stiffened
wings, to perch on Jefferson&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going home, boy,&rdquo; he told the bird, turning his
face to avoid the inquisitive bill. &ldquo;Burwell will see to it that
you get back to Monticello safely, where all the other
mockingbirds will probably be swollen with envy when
they see you lording it over the place. No, I haven&rsquo;t any
sugar tonight. When we get home my grandchildren will
feed you sugar till you&rsquo;ll probably die of obesity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat wearily on the side of the bed and began turning
over papers, studying each, laying them in neat piles.
There were too many of them but each was important to
him. A soft rap came at the door; it opened a crack and
his daughter, Martha Randolph, always called &ldquo;Patsy,&rdquo;
put a turbaned head in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, may I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem that you are already in,&rdquo; he smiled.
&ldquo;You should be downstairs being gay with the rest of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Papa, I&rsquo;m an old woman now. I&rsquo;m thirty-six. Old
enough for caps and a chimney corner, too old for frolicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chimney corner hasn&rsquo;t been built that can hold
you long. You were born restless like your father. You
always want to be on to the next activity, Patsy, no matter
what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come away down here through all that cold
mud to dance and frivol,&rdquo; she argued, arranging her wide
skirt so she could sit beside him on the high bed. &ldquo;I came
to help you pack and fetch you home, but from the looks
of things we&rsquo;re doomed never to get there. What are all
these pages and pages full of strange words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; He rescued some sheets from her hand.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mix them up.&rdquo; He straightened the papers lovingly,
his long freckled fingers deft. &ldquo;These are my Indian vocabularies.
I&rsquo;ve been setting down words from the different
Indian tongues, comparing them and trying to find a
common origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why someone said the other day that you
believed that all the Indians were originally Russians!&rdquo;
Patsy laid the pages in neat piles. &ldquo;Papa, you continually
astound me! With all the frightful responsibilities you&rsquo;ve
had all these years&mdash;buying Louisiana, the country continually
in a row with England and France and this bank
business, not to mention Aaron Burr&mdash;you&rsquo;ve found time
to learn Indian languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t learned many&mdash;only a few words here and
there. It kept my mind off unpleasant things, like having
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
all the Federalists hate me vehemently and make no bones
about it.&rdquo; He quirked his long mouth in an ironic grimace.
&ldquo;Do you know that at this moment there are half a dozen
banquets being eaten in this city where the Federalists are
proposing insulting toasts to the despised &lsquo;Virginian,&rsquo; gloating
over my departure, telling each other, &lsquo;Thank God, at
last we&rsquo;re rid of Jefferson!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, please don&rsquo;t remember those things,&rdquo; pleaded his
daughter. &ldquo;Leave every bitter memory right here on the
shores of this dirty Potomac. Up on the Rivanna on your
mountain the children are already counting hours, eager for
Grandfather to come home. Now, can&rsquo;t we lay all these
papers in a box so this bed can be used for the purpose for
which it was intended? I&rsquo;ll call Burwell. I could drag your
boots off myself but it&rsquo;s hard for me to stoop or bend over
in these murderous stays. Back home I shall never wear
them, no matter if my fashion-minded daughters faint with
horror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me the Misses Randolph have deserted dolls
and toad houses built of mud and gone running after fur-belows!
Maybe I had too many mirrors sent home from
France.&rdquo; He began obediently to lay the papers in a stout
wooden box. &ldquo;Come in, Burwell. The tyrannical Madam
Patsy Randolph says this ex-president has to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a hot posset and a warm brick at his feet, Burwell,&rdquo;
Martha instructed the faithful servant. &ldquo;I wonder if anybody
in the future history of this nation will ever get this
old barn of a mansion really warm? There are more goose-pimples
than dimples and beauty patches on those bare
shoulders downstairs this minute and Dolly Madison whispered
to me that she wished that protocol demanded ermine
capes with velvet linings for officials in this country such
as the kings and lords wear in England. Well, good night,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Papa. I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning before I leave. I do have
to hurry home. Remember there is a large family of small
people there all in need of discipline before you get back
to spoil them all outrageously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never spoil children. I teach them to use their eyes
and their minds,&rdquo; he protested, grunting as Burwell eased
off the tight polished slippers and put shabby old carpet
slippers on his feet. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I determine, Madam.
If you can throw away stays when you are back at Monticello,
I shall discard all fancy boots and slippers, stocks and
tight cravats, and those confounded, silly lacy affairs down
my front. You haven&rsquo;t given away my good green breeches,
I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything of yours is exactly as you left it, Papa. The
moths got at that awful old homespun coat but I suppose
you&rsquo;ll wear it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It comforts my old shoulders and the pockets are all in
the right places,&rdquo; he asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely full of rocks and arrowheads and dried
leaves and dead butterflies at this moment.&rdquo; She bent and
kissed him, her fancy headdress slipping a little. She pulled
it off freeing reddish brown curls to fall over her ears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to bed myself. Those fiddles and trombones can
squawk all night but they won&rsquo;t keep me awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left alone, Thomas Jefferson dug a comfortable hollow
in his pillow and tried to sleep. But too much went coursing
through his mind. That resolution passed by the Virginia
Assembly, especially the words at the end: &ldquo;You carry
with you the sweetest of awards, the recollection of a life
well spent in the service of your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That sentiment assuaged a little some of the bitterer
things. Young Alexander Hamilton, George Washington&rsquo;s
handsome prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s relentless enemy,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
dying, after he had fired dramatically in the air, from the
bullet of Aaron Burr. And there had been Burr, as Jefferson
knew, always plotting, dreaming up his grandiose
schemes to set up an empire of his own in the West, fleeing
to England when his treasonable activities were discovered,
forfeiting his bail.</p>
<p>John Marshall had been to blame for that. John Marshall,
John Adams&rsquo; midnight appointee, named for petty spite,
and the sworn and bitter enemy of Thomas Jefferson, had
so muddled Burr&rsquo;s trial that a jury had acquitted the man of
treason and altered the charge to some trivial misdemeanor.
And then Marshall had had the effrontery to subpoena the
President of the United States as a witness!</p>
<p>These are they who had worked all manner of evil against
me, the words ran through the old man&rsquo;s tired brain. Yet do
I stand and my arm prevails against them. Curious how
darkness and silence always brought back to him some line
or other from the thousands of books he had read. That
was something he would do at Monticello to fill up his
days&mdash;catalogue all his books, almost ten thousand of them
there must be now, for he had sent home boxes full every
year. He would teach his older grandsons, Jefferson Randolph
and Francis Eppes, to appreciate books too, and
some of the girls might show some signs of possessing an
eager mind like his Patsy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Someone opened a door below and the blare of a marching
tune came to his ears which likely meant that the dancing
company were going down the chilly halls to the unfurnished
rooms where the collation was spread on trestle
tables. Jefferson found himself drumming his fingers on his
chest in time to the music. There had been so much martial
music in his life. He thought of Patrick Henry riding into
Williamsburg on that cloudy morning at the head of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
militia. Gallant, shabby Patrick, who had stood so tall in his
run-down boots and worn leather breeches, his coat out at
the elbows, who had twice sent great words ringing on the
air of America, words that were so trumpet-strong and stirring
that they still echoed in the ears of men and made a
small thrill quiver in the breast of Thomas Jefferson himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this be treason, make the most of it!&rdquo; And &ldquo;Give me
Liberty or give me Death!&rdquo; He would hear them again and
again so long as he lived, remembering that they had challenged
the hesitant hearts of rebelling Virginians until they
were ready to dare even the great guns of the Third George
of Hanover.</p>
<p>But now, Jefferson was thinking, how early the fires of
patriotism had cooled in Patrick Henry. Patrick had been
successful at Red Hill, his plantation. He had made some
money, grown old before his time, and been content the
last time Jefferson had seen him to sit under a green tree
with a jug of cool spring water near by and his grandchildren
playing around. Ease and security&mdash;were they the
drugs that abated the eternal challenge in the minds of men?
And did nations like men grow sluggish and apathetic when
they were well fed and bodily comfortable, Jefferson wondered?</p>
<p>Patrick Henry was dead now, and George Washington
was dead. One by one the passionately dedicated builders
of the temple of the Republic had vanished from the arena,
leaving the affairs of state to the younger, noisier men who
had not known the travail, the risks, the fiery trials of the
beginning. I am a lone dead leaf hanging on the tree, the old
man told himself. I am that despised democrat who greeted
pompous envoys in a shabby coat, the one they called Infidel.</p>
<p>That had been his own private joke, his personal secret&mdash;his
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
belief, his relationship with the Almighty. When he was
dead, someone would find the little book in which he had
pasted and annotated all the sayings of Jesus and know how
wrong they had been in their hasty judgment. But now it
did not matter. Nothing mattered now that he was going
home. He had refused a third term as president, adhering to
the precedent of George Washington. Turmoil and trouble
were hot in the air, but somehow his nostrils did not dilate
with the old war-horse eagerness at the threat of conflict.
Now he felt no stallion urge to go charging armed with
words into the midst of any fray. How well life was organized,
he thought, as he found a softer spot in the pillow. Old
age crept on a man unaware, bringing its own opiate to dull
any lingering sense of loss.</p>
<p>At length, letting the weight of weariness have its way
with him, Thomas Jefferson fell asleep. Martha Randolph,
tiptoeing in later, shading a candle with her hand, saw his
face upturned, eyes closed, nose pinched a little, some brown
freckles standing out on the gray, drained cheeks, and
caught the eagle look about him.</p>
<p>He will look like that when he is dead, she thought, as
she blew out the candle and quietly slipped away.</p>
<p class="tb">It was snowing hard when Jefferson awoke early in the
morning.</p>
<p>The raw ugliness of this new city of Washington was
being charitably hidden under a blanket of downy feathers.
The stumps where the big tulip poplars and oaks had been
cut down to open up streets and clear space for building
were now, all of them, so many thrones cushioned with
ermine. The cutting of those trees had grieved Jefferson&rsquo;s
heart. How he hated to see a tree go down, though he had
slaughtered a young forest in his younger years to clear the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
top of his little mountain for the home he visioned there.</p>
<p>He looked down at the narrow streets where sleighs and
wagons were already churning up dark mud to profane the
virgin beauty of the snow.</p>
<p>Martha came in early accompanied by two aides. Jefferson,
half dressed, was eating the breakfast Burwell had
brought up, picking the meat from a fried fish with his
fingers, dipping bits of corn bread into new cane syrup. He
dried his fingers quickly on his handkerchief, gulped the
last swallow of tea, and motioned Burwell to take the food
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what brings you here so early, my dear Patsy?&rdquo; he
inquired. &ldquo;I thought you would be starting out for Richmond
and Charlottesville on the next coach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d never finish this packing alone or let any
one help you.&rdquo; She kissed his forehead, smoothing back his
rough motley of hair. &ldquo;I declare, Burwell, if you don&rsquo;t cut
his hair soon, he&rsquo;ll be riding the country looking like a
mangy old lion!&rdquo; she scolded. &ldquo;Trim this on top and fix
him a proper cue, or I shall go out and buy you a stylish
wig, Mr. Ex-President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stand the things! They&rsquo;re dirty,&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
get everything packed, Patsy. These boys will help me. You
go along home and get a good fire going to thaw out my
old bones after that long three days in that drafty coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never finish packing,&rdquo; she fussed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find
some book or paper you haven&rsquo;t seen in a long time and
spend hours poring over it. I know you, Thomas Jefferson.
You gentlemen bring in all those boxes and, Burwell, see
that Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s trunks and carpetbag are packed. This
baggage will be taken off the barge at Shadwell, Father, and
we&rsquo;ll have wagons sent down to carry it to Monticello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing must be lost!&rdquo; worried Jefferson. &ldquo;Nothing!
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Every paper and pamphlet I&rsquo;ve saved is important. They
contain the history of an era, the story of the birth of this
nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;it would seem that most of them
should be in the Library of Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, while they house that library in such makeshift
quarters,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;Patsy, my dear, I beg of you, go on
to Monticello as we planned. I shall arrive later with everything
I own intact. Just remember that your father has
knocked about the world on his own for a long time, and
I am not yet senile nor decrepit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will admit that you are tired to the bone,&rdquo; she
persisted, &ldquo;and that long trip in this cold weather is not
going to be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit anything, only get out of here now so that I
can get out of this dressing gown and into my breeches!
Burwell, see that my satin breeches and the broadcloth coat
are well aired before you pack them. It will be a long day
before I shall want to be dressed up and elegant again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were quite the beau at that dance last night,&rdquo; Martha
remarked. &ldquo;Several women said to me that they had never
before seen you so witty and gay. And more than one remarked
that it was a great pity that you were leaving Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had never seen me before without the sad old
albatross of responsibility hung on my back,&rdquo; he retorted.
&ldquo;When I gave it over to Jemmy Madison, I felt twenty
years younger in twenty minutes and even several pounds
lighter. Once I&rsquo;m back on my own mountain you&rsquo;ll see, I
shall be merry as a grig&mdash;whatever a grig is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my youth, when you were feeding me huge, nauseous
doses of Plato and Livy, you would have ordered me to go
and look that word up,&rdquo; Patsy reminded him. &ldquo;I can hear
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
you very sternly directing me never to use a word unless
I knew its exact meaning. Fortunately, I know what a grig
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cricket,&rdquo; spoke up one of the aides. &ldquo;My granny
told me a long time ago, a grig is a cricket. When I was a
young-un, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kind of grasshopper,&rdquo; disputed the other aide. &ldquo;A
little grasshopper that fiddles tunes with its hind legs, Mr.
President, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ex-President, Carver. An ex being something that
has been crossed out, obliterated, ignored. I&rsquo;m obliterated
but I can still go on being a grig. Even though I can&rsquo;t fiddle
any more since I broke this wrist in France. I miss my
music, too.&mdash;Well, good-by again, Madam Randolph. Be
sure you take along a warm robe and a shawl. That coach
can be mighty damp and dreary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do the same, Papa, and don&rsquo;t you climb down
halfway home and start out on horseback in this foul
weather. Nothing ever created by Heaven is so treacherous
and mean as this month of March. If they would leave it off
all the calendars, it would please me well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep plenty of elmbark stewing on the hob till I get
home,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;It will cure any phthisic ever contracted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so stubborn,&rdquo; he heard his daughter say to the aide
as she went out. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be surprised at all to see him come
riding home on that horse. If he wants to do it, he&rsquo;ll do it
if it kills him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t kill him, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the man murmured. &ldquo;Mister
Jefferson is still a mighty stout fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>

<div class="verse">
<p class="lr"><i>Monticello: Spring, 1809</i></p>
</div>
<p>Why, why had he saved so many things? Yet
they were all important, all precious. One small
box full of rocks, little packets of earth, dried
leaves, and the desiccated bodies of insects. These George
Clark and Meriwether Lewis had brought back to him from
the long exploring journey they had made, crossing the
country to the Pacific Ocean. Jefferson held out one small,
rattling mummy of a creature in his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see a bug like this, Burwell?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like some kind of scawpin. Got he tail in air like
one too.&rdquo; The old Negro studied the dried object skittishly.
&ldquo;Stinger in that tail, I bet you. You watch out, Mister Tom,
mought be p&rsquo;ison even if he daid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are desert places out there, they told me, where
everything has thorn and stings or stinks.&rdquo; Jefferson
wrapped the desert scorpion carefully in cotton lint. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have to have a glass case built at home to display all these
things. These trophies from Europe too. And this piece of
cannonball that was fired at Ticonderoga. I suppose every
president from this time on will be sent weird mementoes
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
of some battle or discovery or other. John Adams got an
Iroquois scalp and a jawbone some settler had plowed up in
his field, but nothing quite so gruesome has ever come to
me. Now we must count all these boxes and I must see that
they all go aboard the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The storm did not abate. Rather, it grew worse, changing
from snow to sleet and then to icy hostile rain that made
quagmires of the roads and treacherous slippery deadfalls
of every slope. The coach horses slipped and stumbled, the
coach swayed and lurched in the ruts, splashing muddy
water everywhere. Jefferson&rsquo;s bones ached from the jolting;
his elbows were sore from being continually slammed
against the hard leather of the seats. The floor was cold and
wet.</p>
<p>At Shadwell, where the barge landed, having made inquiry
and been assured that all his baggage had been transferred
to wagons, he left the coach and mounted his bay
horse, the patient animal having been led behind at a dragging
pace for many miles. Snow was still thick in the air,
but once in the saddle Jefferson leaned into the wind, gave
the bay his head, and let him warm his sluggish blood in a
brisk canter. Sensing that he was heading home, the horse
loped along, shaking his head in irritation at the snow that
stung his eyelids, but keeping steadily on until the mountains
loomed at last, dark blue and chill upon the horizon.</p>
<p>Martha&rsquo;s husband, Thomas Randolph, had written that
all the people of Albemarle County would be out to meet
him with fife and drum and banner, but Jefferson had urged
Martha to see that there was no public demonstration. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
likely be delayed on the way. I may even get home in the
middle of the night. Head off any hoorah. This is no hero;
this is plain Farmer Jefferson coming home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>When he turned off the highway into the narrow winding
road up his hill, he could restrain the bay no longer.
Weary as the animal was, he broke into a reaching gallop,
and now the brick house was in sight, and streaming out
from every door came people running, bareheaded and
shouting through the storm. His daughter, his son-in-law,
all his grandchildren, and every slave on the place, he was
certain. They swarmed about him, lifting him off his horse,
the jubilant Negroes pressing forward to kiss his hands, his
boots, even his horse.</p>
<p>The children screamed joyfully, &ldquo;Grandfather is home
for ever and ever!&rdquo; With so many arms lifting him, he was
half carried in to the house. In the lofty hall, the ceiling
almost two full stories high, a great fire burned on the
hearth and shone on the trophy-covered walls and the great
clock over the door that worked by cannon ball weights
and faced both indoors and out.</p>
<p>Jefferson sank wearily into a deep chair. He was more
worn and chilled than he wanted to admit, but a great sigh
of contentment made his lips tremble. All around him were
all the things he loved, that he had built, contrived, designed,
invented. The weather indicator on the ceiling that
was controlled by a vane on the roof outside&mdash;his eyes
turned up toward it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still works,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and from the set of the
wind there&rsquo;ll be no good weather for another day at least.
Did the wagons get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Papa, not yet. But the roads are mighty bad, as you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freezing mud. Makes slow traveling. Now, baby,&rdquo; he
protested to a young granddaughter, &ldquo;Grandpapa can take
off his own boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; insisted young Cornelia, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
going to do it for you. Ellen&rsquo;s fetching some wool socks
she knit&mdash;and, Grandpa, one is too long but please don&rsquo;t
mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I promise. Not if it reaches halfway to my
neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found these old slippers in your wardrobe. A mouse
had started to build a nest in one but I brushed it out and
aired it. Thank goodness, he hadn&rsquo;t gnawed any holes in
it.&rdquo; She jumped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear sir,&rdquo; he looked up gratefully at Thomas
Randolph, who was followed by a servant with a steaming
mug on a server, &ldquo;you save my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what you need to heat up your blood, sir.&rdquo; said
Randolph. &ldquo;Another log on the fire, Cassius, and tend the
fires in Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s library and bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jefferson sipped the warm punch slowly while his granddaughters
busied themselves dressing his feet in warm hose
and old slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your breeches are damp, Grandpa,&rdquo; one said. &ldquo;But we
can&rsquo;t do anything about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am marvelously served already.&rdquo; He pulled them close
to kiss their flushed young faces. &ldquo;Burwell will find me
some dry clothes presently as soon as I am warmed and
rested. I see that our Paris lamp hasn&rsquo;t tarnished very much,
Patsy.&rdquo; He looked up at the ceiling. &ldquo;Remember what a
time we had packing that thing? I remember you stuffed
the globes full of hose and shirts and winced every time the
box was moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected it to arrive here a mass of scraps and splinters,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and after you had paid such an outrageous
price for it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that painting you made the worst fuss about.&rdquo;
Jefferson emptied the bowl, handed it to the waiting servant,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
and got to his feet. &ldquo;Ah, my old knees are stiff! But
they still seem willing to support me. Now, I want to see
everything. Yes&rdquo;&mdash;he halted at the door of the high-ceiled
drawing room&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s poor old John the Baptist whom
you hated, Patsy.&rdquo; He went nearer to study the painting
over the mantel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Polly who loathed it most,&rdquo; Martha said. &ldquo;Not
poor old John, all head and no body, but Salome lugging
him on that charger wearing modern clothes and a very
proper turban at that. I&rsquo;d still like to throw that picture
away, Papa. It used to give little Francis Eppes the horrors.
Every time he had to pass through this room he&rsquo;d have
nightmares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice polish on this floor, Patsy,&rdquo; commended Jefferson,
artfully turning her mind away from criticism of one of his
favorite paintings by complimenting the gleam of the parquet
floor. It was the first such oak floor laid in America
and he was very proud of the way it reflected the glitter
of the gilt chairs and sofas he had brought from Paris. They
had cost fabulous amounts too, more than he could afford,
but in his philosophy the things a man wanted and admired,
that made life richer, were worth whatever they cost.</p>
<p>A brief nagging jerk of realism struck him&mdash;that now he
would have to count the cost of things. Let that wait, let it
wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow he would look over his
lands, his farms; he would see how Randolph&rsquo;s management
had benefited them, and study what more must be done to
the still unfinished house. Martha, catching his roving look,
interrupted it with a protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, please! Don&rsquo;t begin right away tearing down
something and building it over. The house is fine as it is
and we all love it&mdash;and you are so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I should be even more tired with no occupation,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
he argued. &ldquo;Of course it will take me some little
time to arrange and dispose of all my books and papers.
Did they build those shelves I wrote you about in November?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Papa, come and see. I gave them the drawing you
made and I&rsquo;m quite sure they followed it exactly.&rdquo; She
walked ahead of him through the great hall and the narrow
passage that led to the southern wing of the house which
contained the library, Jefferson&rsquo;s study, and his bedroom,
with the bed alcove between and the steep winding stairs to
the mezzanine-like second story.</p>
<p>There in the familiar rooms were all the homely things
he had missed&mdash;his shabby old revolving chair, the painted
wooden bench with its leather cushion that just fitted his
lean, weary legs, the round revolving table he had had
built with the legs set right so that the bench would slide
under them and make of table, chair, and bench a comfortable
kind of chaise longue with a high back to shut out
the drafts. There was his file table with octagonal sides,
each side holding a filing drawer labeled with a group of
letters, and his high drawing table with drawers and shelves
that could be adjusted at any angle.</p>
<p>Beside the library fireplace stood a high-backed leather
chair, a pompous and official looking piece of furniture.
Jefferson glared at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came that thing here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Papa, don&rsquo;t you recognize it? It&rsquo;s the chair you
sat in all the time you were vice-president. Mr. Madison
had it sent up by the barge. He thought you would like to
have it,&rdquo; explained Martha.</p>
<p>He snorted. &ldquo;I have spent more eternal hours of boredom
in that miserable chair than in any seat whereon a man has
ever rested his breeches!&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Stick it in a dark
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
corner somewhere. Send it down to the servants&rsquo; quarters.
The office of vice-president is about as tedious an insult to
a man&rsquo;s intelligence as could be conceived. To have to
suffer it for four years is bad enough, but to be reminded
of it the rest of his life is pure persecution. However, I
shall take pains to thank Jemmy Madison properly. He
meant this as a handsome gift. I&rsquo;ll receive it in the same
spirit, but I don&rsquo;t want it around where I have to look at it
and be reminded of Senator Bingham and of John Adams&rsquo;s
being urged to slay a thousand Republicans with the jawbone
of Thomas Jefferson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Papa, don&rsquo;t let past times rankle. Look back on the
happy ones,&rdquo; begged Martha. &ldquo;We did have fun in Paris,
didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you went to school there,&rdquo; mourned one of her
daughters&mdash;Jefferson was not yet entirely sure which was
which&mdash;&ldquo;and saw all those fashionable people and the king
and Napoleon and spoke French all the time, and we have
to learn French with that stupid Miss Fraker. You should
hear her, Grandpa. She pronounces French as it is spelled
in English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says &lsquo;Owy Owy,&rsquo; and we know it should be &lsquo;wee
wee,&rsquo;&rdquo; piped up a smaller one. Was this Virginia or Ellen?
He would have to put his family tree in order soon before
he mortally offended some of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather will teach you proper French when he
gets time,&rdquo; promised their mother. &ldquo;He spent four years
over there and I went to school there and so did Aunt
Maria. But not all that we saw was happy. We saw too
many beggars and hungry people in the streets, something
you will never see in Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see blind Remus when we go to church,&rdquo; said
one child. &ldquo;He sits on the path with his hat in his hand
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
and says, &lsquo;Please, li&rsquo;l missy, give ole Remus a penny?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we put our penny in his hat, then we have
nothing when the verger comes around with the alms basin
and he gives us a disgusted look,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remus doesn&rsquo;t have to beg,&rdquo; said Jefferson. &ldquo;He is
owned by a family able to take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he likes it. Sitting in the sun and hearing people
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s sitting there now, he&rsquo;s being snowed on,&rdquo; said
young Francis Eppes gravely, standing at the window. It
was the first time the quiet, brown-haired boy had spoken
and Jefferson from his seat in the old revolving chair looked
at him sharply. This was his beloved younger daughter
Maria&rsquo;s only child. Maria, christened Mary, called Polly,
and later changing her name in the convent to Maria, pronounced
in the Italian fashion. Maria was gone now these
four years but the pain of her loss was still a quivering fiber
of anguish in Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s heart. She had died, as his
own young wife had died, when her daughters were small,
having borne too many children, wasting away after the
last childbirth, fading slowly day by day. Polly&rsquo;s young
husband, Jack Eppes, still lived at Eppington not far away,
but Francis spent a great deal of time at Monticello with
Martha&rsquo;s healthy, noisy brood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Francis,&rdquo; Jefferson called gently. &ldquo;Come
here and let your grandfather look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always moping and looking out windows,&rdquo; volunteered
a young Randolph. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he hasn&rsquo;t any
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and talk to me, Francis,&rdquo; urged Jefferson. &ldquo;You
and I should be friends. I have no mother either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy came obediently and stood by the arm of the
chair, his big eyes, so like Polly&rsquo;s, very sober.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Old people don&rsquo;t have mothers, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did. Till I was a grown up man. I had a handsome
mother whose name was Jane and I still think about her
when I stand and look out of windows. I wonder if I&rsquo;m the
kind of a man she would have wanted me to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be what my mother wanted me to be,&rdquo; said small
Francis plaintively. &ldquo;My father says she wanted me to be
a great man like my grandfather, but how can I be like you,
sir? All the things you&rsquo;ve done won&rsquo;t ever be done again,
ever, will they? There will never be another Declaration
of Independence and you wrote that. I know. My father
told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jefferson circled the lad with an arm. All about, clustered
close to the fire, the young Randolphs were abruptly and
amazingly quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; the old man agreed. &ldquo;I did write that paper,
didn&rsquo;t I? And after I&rsquo;d written it, four other men sat around
in Philadelphia for about a week and picked it to pieces and
made changes in it and couldn&rsquo;t make up their minds
whether to adopt it or not. I guess they never would have
made up their minds and we&rsquo;d still be British subjects and
paying taxes to the king. But at last they all decided to
accept the Declaration of Independence, leaving out some
parts I had labored hard to make perfect. So&mdash;we declared
ourselves independent of Great Britain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small Randolphs were convulsed in a hysteria of
giggles but young Francis kept a grave face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the fourth of July, 1776,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I know the
names of those other men too, Grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; piped up a cousin. &ldquo;One was John Adams and
one was Benjamin Franklin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Roger Sherman of Connecticut and Robert Livingston
of New York,&rdquo; finished Francis, &ldquo;and Thomas Jefferson
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
of Virginia. But you should have been the first man
to sign it, Grandfather. Why did you let John Hancock
beat you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the president of the Congress, my son. It was
his right to put his name first. Have you read the Declaration,
any of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; shouted some older ones. &ldquo;We know it by heart.&rdquo;
And straightway there began a chanting recitation, the
big ones trying to drown out the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Jefferson jumped up, waving his hands for silence.
&ldquo;Enough! Enough! You know it. I concede that you know
it. Better than your grandfather no doubt, for I have to
think hard at times to remember parts of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Ann, the oldest Randolph daughter, who broke up
the conclave around the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, the wagons have come!&rdquo; she announced
from the door. &ldquo;Do you want all those boxes brought in
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of them.&rdquo; He jumped up and was quickly at the
door. Now he would open and arrange all his papers at his
leisure. Slaves tramped in and out through the outer library,
endlessly piling up heavy parcels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-nine,&rdquo; counted Martha finally. &ldquo;Papa, there
should be thirty. I know. I counted them twice in Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has been lost or stolen,&rdquo; he worried, &ldquo;and
I won&rsquo;t know what it is until I have emptied every box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it is!&rdquo; she cried, studying the pile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
that wooden box we packed in your bedroom&mdash;there at the
last. The one that had all your Indian writing in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My comparative study of all the Indian languages,&rdquo; he
fretted. &ldquo;Some one must go back at once. Thomas, send
two boys down the river in a canoe tomorrow to search the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
bank where all these parcels were unloaded from the barge.
That Indian work could be valuable. I meant to pursue it
further. It must not be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lost box was found a few days later. It had been
torn open on the muddy river bank and obviously the
thieves, seeking for money, had been disappointed in the
contents, for the precious papers were torn and scattered
far and wide. What little could be salvaged, Martha dried
and pressed but little was legible on the sodden sheets.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s years of study of the Indian tongues
was forever lost.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="lr"><i>Monticello: Summer, 1809</i></p>
</div>
<p>Spring came burgeoning over the Virginia hills,
warming quickly into promise of summer. The bulbs
Thomas Jefferson and his lost wife Martha had
planted so long ago pushed up through the damp earth and
the children came running excitedly to call him whenever
a bud showed, tight and green-sheathed above its protecting
sword blades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, come quick! The Roman Empress tulip
has a big bud showing and a teeny one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, Virginia.&rdquo; She was one of the younger ones, still
small enough so that he could toss her on his shoulder.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and see but not touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know. They turn brown and don&rsquo;t open out to be
flowers. Francis pinched the Queen of the Amazons last
spring and it never bloomed at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some little girl tattled, which isn&rsquo;t nice, do you
think?&rdquo; he teased, waiting for the others who invariably
like hungry chicks came flying out several doors whenever
he walked on the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francis thinks he is kind of special because he doesn&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
live here all the time,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;but he does stay for long
times and he has lessons with us and so he shouldn&rsquo;t be any
different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francis,&rdquo; explained Jefferson, &ldquo;does not have a lot of
people to love him. He&rsquo;s not rich in love like all the Randolphs.
Now let us look into the case of this foreign woman,
the Roman Empress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent over the bed where the nubby little buds ventured
up into the thin, warming sun of spring. An old pain,
long kept hidden deep stirred again in him, stabbing at his
heart, clasping icy fingers at his throat to make an aching
cramp there. Martha, his own Martha, so long gone, so
always present and living still in that deep place where no
person, no plaudit, no antagonism or ambition had ever
been permitted. He could almost see her long white fingers
now, as they had pressed the warm earth down lovingly
over the dry, somnolent bulbs, always so delicately careful
not to break an embryo root or smother too deep the promise
of the crown.</p>
<p>She had been heavy with child that spring day, carrying
the son who had only lived a few days, and when he protested
that she must not tire herself she had given him a
little push and said, &ldquo;No, I must do it, I must plant them.
Don&rsquo;t you know that whatever I plant now will grow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The years&mdash;the years! Almost thirty of them now since
she had looked at him with dimming eyes, and said, &ldquo;Promise
that my children will never have a stepmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had kept that promise. No other woman had ever
approached the walled-off chamber of his heart where she
was enshrined. There were times when, observing Patsy&rsquo;s
healthy brood, an impatient bitterness colored with a haunting
kind of guilt would burn in him. Too many children&mdash;six
of them in ten years&mdash;had been too much for Martha&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
frail strength; yet Patsy had borne eleven easily and naturally.
Childbirth to her had not been the draining, killing
ordeal that had taken Martha, and their well-loved Maria
also. He wondered often if Jack Eppes, Maria&rsquo;s young husband,
felt too that continuing, sickening weight of self-accusation.</p>
<p>He got to his feet quickly, bidding the sad ghosts of the
past to depart. &ldquo;Off with you all now,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
time for lessons. Run, before your mother scolds you and
me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Race you?&rdquo; screamed one Randolph to his sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;start fair!&rdquo; they shrieked in protest.</p>
<p>Jefferson called a halt. &ldquo;Line up. Smallest one three paces
ahead of the next. You here, Cornelia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ellen, Grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Some day I shall hang labels around all your
necks. No inching forward now! You&mdash;big fellow, three
paces to the rear. Now, when I drop my handkerchief&mdash;go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small feet flew, braids flopped, hats fell off, and happy
squeals and shouts made pandemonium. Flushed and hot and
breathless they straggled back to the dreariness of lessons,
the older ones knowing that they must learn history and
Latin verbs well, for inevitably before the day ended their
grandfather would be catechizing them and putting on a
sober, disappointed look if they missed the correct answers.</p>
<p>There were letters waiting for replies and papers to be
gone over and sorted in his study, but Jefferson discovered
a reluctance in himself to begin these tasks. Pacing the long
terrace to the south he came to the door of a little one-room
building. This was what had always been called Honeymoon
Cottage, the first room built at Monticello. He had
lived a bachelor&rsquo;s life in that one room in &rsquo;71 and, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Shadwell, his mother&rsquo;s home, had burned, it had become
his only and permanent home.</p>
<p>He took from his pocket the big iron key he had carried
for so many years, turned the stiff lock slowly lest some
rusted part should snap, and opened the door. Long unused,
as it had been for years, the room still held a fresh, sweetish
smell of femininity. Patsy had obviously kept it aired and
cleaned, knowing that it was still the secret abode of his
tired old heart. At the windows the dimity curtains were
fresh and starched, the valance and tester of the bed still
bright with old-fashioned wool embroidery. His own
mother had worked those many-hued flowers and curious
fruits, coloring the wool in her own dye pots with homemade
dyes set with alum and vinegar.</p>
<p>The slender posts of the bed were polished, as was the
brass fender of the fireplace. An armchair stood on the
hearth rug and Jefferson sank into it, relaxing his long legs,
staring into the cold fireplace where three dry logs rested
on the andirons.</p>
<p>His mind whet, far back in time, thirty-six years back,
to a snowy January night in &rsquo;72, when he had brought his
bride, Martha Wayles Skelton, to this room, the only home
he had to offer her.</p>
<p>Monticello had been a beginning then, some walls raised,
part of a wing roofed over, windows boarded up, floors
rough laid and strewn with scraps and sawdust where they
were laid at all. But nowhere within the ambitiously planned
structure a room complete enough for a lady, and the
winter snows had halted all work until a thaw came.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson could almost visualize that spindle-legged,
freckle-faced bridegroom, that brash twenty-nine-year-old
fiddler who had charmed his lady with his music
and won her away from a swarm of admirers by tricking
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
them with a clever stratagem. It had never occurred to him
in those courting days at the Wayles&rsquo; place, The Forest,
that he might likely be catalogued with some of Martha&rsquo;s
other swains as an ambitious country boy and embryo lawyer
set on improving his state by marrying a rich young
widow. He had cared too much for Martha, loving her, he
was arrogantly certain, as no man had ever loved a woman
before, and he had brought her here to this cold little room
so confident of her love and courage that a chill or two did
not matter.</p>
<p>Now he thought back on that snowy ride up from Blenheim,
where, because of the deepening snow, they had been
obliged to leave the chaise in which they had started out
from Williamsburg, as well as the warm robes and blankets
with which it had been loaded. There had been a debate,
he remembered now, about whether they should ride on or
wait for morning, but Martha had laughed his misgivings
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can weather any storm that you can weather, Thomas
Jefferson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saddle horses had been brought, his own tired team
stabled, and the slave who had driven the chaise sent to bed
with orders to drive to Monticello in the morning. Jefferson
recalled now his dubious concern when he discovered
that the snow on the mountain road was eighteen inches
deep.</p>
<p>He had ridden ahead, breaking a track for Martha&rsquo;s horse,
trying to shield her as best he could from the storm that
stung their eyelids and sifted inside collars and up sleeves.
But Martha had been undismayed. She had shouted jokes
at him through the wind, ordering him to wait now and
then while she wiped the snow off her face. Eight miles
they had had to climb, the horses sliding, stumbling, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
blowing through the dark until at last they saw the brick
piles and scaffolding of what was to be their home through
the weird snow light.</p>
<p>Not a light showed, not a feather of smoke lay on the
air. Where were all the black people who should have been
there ready to serve them with warm fires and a hot meal?
Jefferson burned with hot angry impatience; then common
sense prevailed. No one could possibly have expected them
home at this hour. It was far past midnight.</p>
<p>The honeymoon cottage felt a trifle chilly now to his
old bones, but on that January night long ago it had held a
tomblike cold. Just as he had done on that night, now he
rummaged the old brass pot beside the hearth, finding scraps
of slivers of kindling, mounding them into a heap under the
logs, struck flint, and fired a bit of bark. The tiny flame
wavered and grew as he blew upon it and coaxed fire to
burn, as he had done for his beloved. Finally it leaped in a
bright blaze to the resinous pine logs and Jefferson dropped
into the chair again, trying to vision her there, shaking the
snow off her riding skirt, holding one foot and then the
other near to the blaze while he held her up with a supporting
arm.</p>
<p>They had been very silly that night, he knew now, and
was glad of the gay nonsense that had lightened the beginning
for them. Life had been grim enough afterward. He
was happy now to recall the laughter. There had been a
mouse who came calling and Martha had not screamed or
leaped on a chair as his sisters did. Instead, she had waggled
her fingers at the mouse, as it sat upright blinking at them,
and had exclaimed, &ldquo;Thomas, it has big brown eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had played the fiddle for her then, the same fiddle
faithful Jupiter had saved from the burning ruin of Shadwell.
Now, he could not play any more. Just as well. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
music had belonged to people he loved. To Martha, to
Dabney Carr, who had married his sister and been his heart&rsquo;s
best friend until his untimely death. Dabney Carr lay now
out on this hill, under the oak where they two had sat
together while young Thomas Jefferson blithely planned
the place he would have here someday. They had sworn
then that the two of them would both be buried under those
trees. Jefferson had kept that promise. His music had belonged
for a while with his friendship for Patrick Henry,
another fiddler and a blithe and restless spirit, but most especially
it had been for Martha. He had wooed her with that
fiddle&mdash;their duets had excluded her other suitors&mdash;now it
was as well that it would be forever silent, now that there
were no more loved ears to hear.</p>
<p>Ten years he had had before she faded away, and he had
been too much away from home in those years. First as a
member of the rebellious House of Burgesses that had been
peremptorily dissolved by Governor Dunmore. That assembly
had marched off to hold meetings in the tavern and
out of their angry discussions had grown the idea of the
Colonial Congress.</p>
<p>Their first year had brought him his little daughter, the
other Martha who had been promptly called Patsy because
there were already two Marthas, her mother and her aunt,
Jefferson&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>For too much of the time, Jefferson knew now, he had
kept to himself when he was at home, shut away with his
books. Out of the works of the old and new philosophers
and historians he had striven to evolve some plan that could
help a troubled America. While hammering went on around
him, as the house of his dreams slowly took form and shape,
he had struggled to put his ideas into words. But the essay
he finally evolved with much labor was called too bold by
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
the members of the assembly. Then, in that miasmic summer
of &rsquo;73, the fever had laid him low and his best friend,
Dabney Carr, had died.</p>
<p>I left her too much alone, he told himself as he watched
the fire burn low. She had been ill so often, weak and sorrowful
because of the loss of three children, two stillborn,
while he was off riding for days to reach Philadelphia, there
to have a part in the birth of the new nation. Now that
nation lived, but a part of his life was forever dead and lay
on that grassy slope down the climbing road.</p>
<p>A loud knock at the door broke off his gloomy reverie.
The door was pushed open and Burwell pushed his head in
hesitantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister Tom, it past one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; the old Negro complained,
&ldquo;and they got that horse out here waiting for you
so long he done pawed a hole mighty nigh deep enough to
bury hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Burwell.&rdquo; Jefferson jumped up. &ldquo;I was just sitting
here thinking about old times. I&rsquo;ll ride now as soon as I
change my breeches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, suh, Mister Tom. I done looked everywhere for
you. Then I seen this little bitty smoke comin&rsquo; out this yere
chimney. Ain&rsquo;t been nobody in this little room for a time
now &rsquo;cept Miss Martha. She fetch the gals in here to clean
it up good before you come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be anybody in here from now on, Burwell.
Cover this fire so it will be safe. This place is too full of
ghosts and ghosts are sad company when you are getting
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, you ain&rsquo;t old, Mister Tom,&rdquo; protested the slave,
shoveling ashes carefully over the dying embers. &ldquo;You
peert as a lot of young men. Might get you a young wife
yet. Out in the quarters the people been saying, now Mister
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Tom come home for good likely he get him a lady of his
own. Miss Patsy, she a fine woman but she got Mister Tom
Randolph and all them chillen and you ain&rsquo;t got nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, Burwell. And all the others. They&rsquo;re all
mine.&rdquo; He took out the iron key and carefully locked the
door. Ghosts, he was thinking, had so little respect for locks.

<p class="lr"><i>Monticello: Late summer, 1809</i></p>
</div>
<p>The house was almost complete now. He had torn
away what did not please him and rebuilt some parts
to suit his matured ideas. New white paint gleamed
on the cornices; the square windows in what he had called
his &ldquo;sky room&rdquo; on the third floor had been replaced by
round and half-round openings. But now in what he had
wished would be a quiet summer he was plagued by the
same hosts that for several years had made George Washington&rsquo;s
life miserable.</p>
<p>Too many visitors came to Monticello. They came uninvited
to see the man who had written the Declaration of
Independence. They came from miles away, some on horseback,
some in carriages, some even in ox-drawn wagons.
Patsy, who had hoped to return to her own place at Bedford
long enough to see to the preservation of the vegetables
and fruits for winter, abandoned the idea and stayed on
with her children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people, these strangers&mdash;what are we to do with
them?&rdquo; she worried. &ldquo;Some of them come great distances.
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
They have to be kept for the night; they must be fed. Your
pet steward, Petit, is getting really fractious, Papa, and I
have to keep the people cooking practically night and day.
They look at this handsome house and believe that Thomas
Jefferson is a rich man, that he can afford to entertain them&mdash;people
we&rsquo;ve never seen before and will likely never see
again&mdash;and, Papa, you know it isn&rsquo;t true. You aren&rsquo;t rich
enough to afford housing and feeding so many. The farms
don&rsquo;t pay as they should, and we are often hard pressed to
feed and clothe our own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said heavily, &ldquo;but what is a Virginia gentleman
to do? We cannot turn people away. There is no
inn anywhere near where they can buy food or lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not put up some barriers?&rdquo; suggested young Jefferson
Randolph. &ldquo;Charge everyone a shilling to come in.
We might make enough to pay the taxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor joke, my son. We would outrage every tradition
of Southern hospitality. But I do wish that some part
of this house that I built for my family could be private
and belong only to us. They invade every corner without
leave or apology. Yesterday they were all over my study.
They wanted to see everything. They even pulled out the
drawers in my desk and turned over some personal papers.
And these were people of some quality too&mdash;from Delaware,
they said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dining room Jefferson had devised a dumb-waiter
at either end of the mantelpiece. These ingenious carriers
descended into the basement close by the wine cellars and
were used to bring things up from the cool rooms below by
an easy pull on the rope. Not long since he had found a man
in the dining room fascinated by the device and happily
running the carriers up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you reckon he&rsquo;s got this here for?&rdquo; he demanded
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
of Jefferson. &ldquo;Was he fixing a place to hide quick
from the Injuns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courteously Jefferson explained the working of the device.
&ldquo;It has never talked back in all the years it has been in
operation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so we call it a dumb-waiter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These rich people got it mighty fine,&rdquo; commented the
stranger. &ldquo;My old lady took a fancy to that bed he&rsquo;s got
in yonder,&rdquo; said the intruder blandly, &ldquo;one pulls up out of
the way in daytime. We only got a two-room house. Be
mighty handy to have one of them there, put the young-uns
in it, and haul &rsquo;em out of sight when we get tired of their
racket. All these young-uns ain&rsquo;t Jefferson&rsquo;s, I figure? Got
quite a passel of &rsquo;em around, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of these are my grandchildren&mdash;some are nieces
and nephews. Are those your children in there?&rdquo; Jefferson
pointed with some annoyance to four towheaded youngsters,
none of them too clean, who were bouncing up and
down on the tapestried seats of the gilt chairs in the drawing
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, them&rsquo;s my brats. Reckon they&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; kind of
hungry. Old lady said we&rsquo;d ought to leave &rsquo;em home down
Culpepper way but I said, No, this here Thomas Jefferson
was the people&rsquo;s friend, even if he did get to be president,
and they&rsquo;d ought to git a chance to see him. He around here
any place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Thomas Jefferson,&rdquo; said the ex-president coolly.
&ldquo;And I suggest that you educate your children to have
respect for the property of other people, sir. Those chairs
they are jumping about on were brought all the way from
France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger stared incredulously at the elderly figure
before him. Shabby old brown coat. Faded velveteen
breeches. Home-knit hose that showed signs of much mending,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
and, most unbelievable of all, a pair of old run-down
carpet slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I took you for a butler or a
footman or something. You, Caleb and Beulah! Get away
from them fancy cheers. Git outside, all you-uns, and go
sit in the wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dreadful as some of them were, they could not be sent
away hungry. Food that should have been sent to market
to provide money for the family expenses, these visitors ate
and ate like locusts. Patsy rebelled at using the beautiful
Chippendale table that had been given Jefferson by his old
friend and teacher, George Wythe of Williamsburg. So
trestle tables were set up in the warming kitchens in the
basement and picnic hampers passed about by servants on
the lawn on fine days. A few important and genteel groups
were dined in the big dining room, but there were often too
many of those. All those letters that her father wrote, she
thought impatiently, probably half of them were invitations
to people in Philadelphia or Washington or New York to
come to Monticello for long visits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I sleep thirty-one people?&rdquo; she worried, on
a July night. &ldquo;And, Papa, we had better plan on having a
lot more linen woven right away. The woman washed
fifty sheets yesterday. They&rsquo;ll wear out fast at that rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jefferson sighed. &ldquo;I came home to find peace and there is
no peace. What have I done in my past, my dear, that such
hordes of admirers should descend upon me? I&rsquo;ve been a
very ordinary fellow. I&rsquo;ve always been homely, ungainly,
entirely unprepossessing. No one was more surprised than
I when your mother agreed to marry me. There she was&mdash;a
beautiful and gracious woman with a fortune of her own&mdash;and
I a struggling young lawyer, a long-legged shide-poke
of a fellow, freckled and coarse-maned as a lion, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
no grace except that I could fiddle. And you know I was
an unpopular president. The number of them that hated me
was legion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the good plain people. Not these people who come
up here in old carts or riding raw-boned nags just to get a
glimpse of Thomas Jefferson, champion of the people,&rdquo; his
daughter said. &ldquo;Two words of yours will never die in their
ears: &lsquo;Free and Equal.&rsquo; And because you made them feel
free and equal, they come to see you&mdash;in droves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t slept in my own bed all summer,&rdquo; complained
Ann, the oldest daughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve slept on hard pallets laid
down on the floor till all my bones are worn raw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst is the curious women&mdash;the young ones,&rdquo; said
Ellen. &ldquo;They open our wardrobes and finger our clothes.
They even open drawers and jewel boxes. We should have
locks on everything, Grandfather. One girl from away
down on the Eastern Shore asked me to give her my chip-straw
bonnet. The one Mrs. Adams sent me last summer.
She said we were all rich and her folks were terribly poor
and she hadn&rsquo;t a decent bonnet to get married in because
they were fishermen and the run of shad had been bad this
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could have given her the bonnet, Ellen. I would
have bought you another one,&rdquo; said her grandfather.</p>
<p>And gone in debt for it, thought his daughter, with a
tinge of exasperation&mdash;when he had so many debts already!</p>
<p>Jefferson put his arms about his granddaughters. &ldquo;Soon,
my dears, there will come a frost and deep snows and sleet
and the roads will become difficult or impassable. Then
nobody will come to see us and you will be moping around
the house because you are bored and lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared her sister, &ldquo;not if young Mister
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Bankhead has a horse long-legged enough to wade the
drifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; flashed back her sister, &ldquo;will be primping and
ordering all the servants and the children about in case
young Mister Coolidge should decide to come riding down
the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother says I&rsquo;m too young,&rdquo; sighed Ellen, &ldquo;but you
know, Grandfather, that fourteen isn&rsquo;t terribly young.
Why, mother was only seventeen when she married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look what happened to me!&rdquo; cried her mother.
&ldquo;Six of you great greedy daughters, all clamoring that you
should have beaux before you are out of pinafores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are seventeen, Ellen,&rdquo; Jefferson assured the
girl, &ldquo;I personally shall dispatch a very polite invitation to
young Mister Coolidge, whoever he is, to come calling at
Monticello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t want to come then. He&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m an old
maid and I will be! He&rsquo;ll be looking for somebody young
and fresh like Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah! I wouldn&rsquo;t look at him,&rdquo; sniffed redheaded Virginia,
who had a crop of bright coppery freckles like her
grandfather. &ldquo;By the time he&rsquo;s an old man he&rsquo;ll be fat as
a pig and probably grunt when he moves and squeal when
he&rsquo;s fed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not!&rdquo; flared Ellen. &ldquo;Anyway you&rsquo;re just jealous.
She doesn&rsquo;t like having red hair, Grandfather, and she
hates every one of us who haven&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I have red hair and I&rsquo;m very proud of it!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;Shame on you all for quarreling among yourselves.
I used to have a wise old friend named Benjamin
Franklin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know about him. You told us before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know what he said too,&rdquo; put in Ellen patiently. &ldquo;If
we don&rsquo;t hang together we may all hang separately.&rdquo; Definitely,
she was thinking, grandfather could at times be a bit
tiresome. &ldquo;And a penny saved is a penny earned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not one of us ever sees a penny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sad situation,&rdquo; remarked Jefferson, rummaging
through the pocket of his worn old green breeches. &ldquo;Ah,
I do seem to have a few pennies. Let me count. There must
be one apiece. Now&rdquo;&mdash;he announced as he laid a coin in each
warm eager palm&mdash;&ldquo;you have each the foundation for a
fortune. Guard it well, for there are long years ahead of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The years ahead of them! Thinking of those years
brought back the old touch of anxiety. What would he be
able to do for them, for these young things, born of his
blood, hostages to fortune?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who watches the pence need not be anxious about
the pounds,&rdquo; he quoted more of his old friend Franklin,
dubiously aware that his audience were no longer listening.
Slowly he walked back to his study, turning to close the
door almost in the face of a man who escorted three women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sir,&rdquo; Jefferson said as the three stared indignantly.
&ldquo;I am Thomas Jefferson. You are very welcome in
my house but at this moment I must beg to be excused and
be about some urgent business.&rdquo; And he turned the key in
the lock.</p>
<p>The letter lay in the drawer where he had left it. He took
it out, lifted the seal again, and let the single sheet slide out
into his hand.</p>
<p>It was a very brief and slightly curt note from a Philadelphia
banker. A friend for whom Jefferson had felt a
sudden compassion and whom he had trusted had abruptly
gone bankrupt. The note Jefferson had endorsed for this
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
friend, with the hope of helping him recoup his fortunes,
was now long overdue, unpaid and collectible; since Mr.
Jefferson had put his personal endorsement upon the paper
he was now legally assumed to be liable for the full amount
of payment.</p>
<p>The note was drawn for twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="lr"><i>Monticello: Autumn, 1809</i></p>
</div>
<p>With a frantic kind of energy that early autumn,
Jefferson forsook his books and set himself to
the job of assaying and recuperating his own
personal estate. During his long absences, Thomas Randolph,
and his son, young Jefferson after him, had done their
best by the vast property&mdash;the acres about Monticello, and
the farm, Poplar Grove, a few miles away. But many fields
had been neglected and weeds and brush had taken over;
the slaves, having no firm master, had learned to shirk tasks
cleverly and leave much undone.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson had never been a harsh master, but
now he became a stern and demanding one. Nails must be
made and bricks burned, both for his own building plans
and for sale in the market. His French friend, Du Pont de
Nemours, on his last visit had brought him a small flock of
merino sheep. Jefferson enjoyed supervising the shearing
of these sheep, and the washing of the wool, and watched
the carding, spinning, and weaving going on under Martha&rsquo;s
supervision. He decided to have a suit of clothes made from
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
his own fine woolen cloth and busied himself drawing
patterns, measuring, and figuring for days.</p>
<p>The wrist that had been broken in Paris had never been
properly set, and he found using drawing tools and writing
letters more and more of a painful chore. And always he
was interrupted by guests. Some he had invited, regretting
later his hospitable impulse, but the uninvited continued to
find their way up the winding road to his mountain.</p>
<p>He must, he determined, have a place that was his own
where he could study and work undisturbed either by the
family or by these strangers, most of whom he was certain
had only one desire&mdash;to be able to go home and boast that
they had seen the great Thomas Jefferson and the fabulous
house he had created.</p>
<p>He would have a study built at the far end of the north
promenade immediately. So promptly he set about having
seasoned lumber hauled from the sawmill, bricks burned,
and nails and hardware forged in the smithy. He spent a
day drawing a plan for a small, one-room building.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he found an opportunity occasionally to slip
away with one or two grandchildren for a brief stay at
Poplar Grove, his farm, where he could have a little quiet
and relaxation. But always an impelling urgency drove him.
He must write letters. He must counsel James Madison
about whether or not it would be wise to keep America out
of war, with conflicts raging all over Europe. Napoleon was
running wild and perhaps the British should be left alone to
contain and subdue him.</p>
<p>He must write, too, to his old friend, the Marquis de
Lafayette, and invite him to Monticello for a visit. Lafayette
had been in prison, and suffered hardships and loss of
fortune. The debt America owed Lafayette had never been
paid, and, to Jefferson&rsquo;s mind, had never been adequately
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
acknowledged, and he felt responsibility to prod the consciences
of men in power to do something about that. All
these ideas possessed him, then at times were diminished by
a kind of inner irony. Who was he, to be so concerned about
a debt owed to any man when he himself was likely faced
with a weight of debts he had not yet had the courage to
calculate?</p>
<p>Some time soon when his private lair was completed he
must sit down for a day or a week and put all his books and
accounts in order. It was a kind of cowardice in him, he
knew, that put off the reckoning from one day to another.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his new wool suit was finished and he was
more pleased than ever with the fineness of the material.
With the coming of winter, Martha had taken her own
brood back to their plantation, but when she returned for
a brief visit Jefferson dressed up in his new clothes and
paraded before her, grinning like a happy boy.</p>
<p>Martha gave a little surprise shriek. &ldquo;Papa! Pantaloons!
I never would have believed you would give up those old
knee breeches and long stockings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re warmer,&rdquo; Jefferson turned and posed naively,
&ldquo;and the London papers that still come through in spite of
the embargo say that they are the new style in England.
Jemmy Madison wrote that he had a pair made&mdash;black
broadcloth. Every hair and bit of lint sticks to that stuff.
I&rsquo;m sending Jemmy enough of this goods to have himself
a suit made. With the president wearing it, we might be able
to sell more in Washington. Some friends who were here
last week said the cloth was better than the finest wool that
comes from England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will certainly help if you can find a new product to
market. All these visitors this summer devoured so much of
our substance that should have gone for ready money, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
money, Papa, is what you need badly, as I&rsquo;m sure you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too well, Patsy. Too well! I&rsquo;m admitting now to you
what you must have surmised or suspected for a long time.
I am a fine farmer on paper. I&rsquo;ve been full of wonderful
plans and theories, and on paper they looked fine and profitable,
but somehow they have all failed to pay off in cash.
All those vineyards and olive groves I planted so hopefully&mdash;I
have just compelled myself to compute the cost and
returns on that venture. The whole project adds up to a
substantial loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And because of this trouble with the shipping your
wheat is mildewing in the bins because it can&rsquo;t be shipped
to market,&rdquo; she reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And across the ocean people in need of bread are starving,&rdquo;
he added sorrowfully. &ldquo;If there were any way to
give the stuff away to those who suffer for lack of it&mdash;but
alas, there is none!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people, always the people, thought his daughter.
A world full of people, and if he had his way he would
free and feed all of them. In the meantime he was dubious
about spending the money for a new pair of spectacles, but
bent close to his desk peering through an old pair that had
one bow mended with black thread stiffened with glue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have a new cushion in that old chair, Papa,&rdquo;
she suggested. &ldquo;If you sit on that thin one in those wool
breeches, they&rsquo;ll be worn to a shine and show thin spots
mighty quickly. I&rsquo;ll tell one of the women to stitch up a
stout canvas cover and stuff it with plenty of feathers.&rdquo; She
moved to the high window and looked off across the hill.
&ldquo;Those mountains look like winter,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;In
spring and summer a blue haze makes them dim and far and
restful to look at, but in winter their crests stand out sharp
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
and blue and cold and a bit hostile. I hope you&rsquo;ve had
plenty of wood cut and piled. You&rsquo;ll need big fires, especially
if everyone comes home for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frowned a little, looked startled. &ldquo;Christmas?&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;Is it near&mdash;and is it so important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew back a little. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s important! Don&rsquo;t
tell me, Papa, that those people who called you Jefferson
the Infidel had any truth to back up their accusations? Don&rsquo;t
tell me that you don&rsquo;t believe that the Son of God was born
on Christmas day and that it is a holy day to be remembered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not an infidel,&rdquo; he said soberly. &ldquo;I have never denied
the existence and the power of God. And I have studied
extensively the sayings of Jesus. I have also never discovered
in all my reading any proof that he was born on the
twenty-fifth of December&mdash;especially as the calendar has
been changed several times since the period began that men
call Anno Domini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the day the Church sets apart as a holy day. For me,
Papa, and for my children, that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Martha a
bit tartly. &ldquo;Surely there have been times when Christmas
was important in your life, though you&rsquo;ve been at home so
little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; He was quick to try to mollify her. Patsy in
an acid mood, he remembered, could be a trifle difficult.
&ldquo;I remember times at Shadwell when my mother was alive.
And before my father died there was always some kind of
feasting, a goose saved and fattened and a fat pig killed for
the Negroes, and mother usually had suckets of some sort
for the young ones and opened her best brandied peaches
and preserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember when Mama was alive,&rdquo; she looked off
pensively into the lonely blue of the hills, &ldquo;we had one
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Christmas. The people brought in holly and you mixed
punch in a big bowl and people came, unless the snow was
too deep. And once I remember you took my mother to
church, but she came home unhappy because you stood
outside and talked politics all through the service. But after
that you were seldom at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made her unhappy too often,&rdquo; he reproached himself.
&ldquo;I was trying to help build a nation, Patsy. We were living
in perilous times. Why, you must remember the war&mdash;when
Tarleton came to Monticello? I rode sixty miles in
one night to get here in time to get you all safely away from
the British dragoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was five. I remember. Aunt Martha Carr was here with
her boys and we were all piled into the chaise, with some
of the servants sitting on behind with their legs dangling
and old Jupiter lashing the horses to a gallop. Mother cried
because she was sure they would capture you and burn the
house down. She said that if Tarleton could capture the
man who wrote the Declaration of Independence, the king
would make him a general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to speak boastfully, that likely was true. But he
didn&rsquo;t capture me nor burn the house. Instead Captain
McLeod made himself very comfortable in it for two days,
while poor old black Caesar was hidden under the planks
of the portico, where he had crawled to hide all our silver.
He had pried up the floor and dropped down under, and
black Martin saw some horsemen galloping up the drive
and dropped the planks back, and there was faithful old
Caesar underneath, hungry and scared for two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember hearing about it,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;and about
the soldier who pushed a gun into Martin&rsquo;s face and ordered
him to tell which way you had gone or he would
shoot. Martin said, &lsquo;Go ahead, shoot!&rsquo; And after that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
never got tired of telling it. But, Papa, we were supposed
to be talking about Christmas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How could he make himself clear to her, how could he
explain to his literal downright-minded daughter, that harried
and anxious Thomas Jefferson had been turned away
by destiny from all the simple folkways and beliefs? From
all the prosaic and ordinary things that were good and dedicated
to wholesome living into a world of desperate struggle,
intrigue, cabal, tragedy, and strife?</p>
<p>Now that he was becalmed in this quiet backwater of life
he could see his own career and know that it had been
always headlong, more than a little frenzied, and too much
of it precipitate and unpredictable and little under his own
control&mdash;and in that chaotic whirling by of history there
had been too little time for a man to meditate and even
assay his own beliefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have lived, Patsy, like a man snatched up
by a whirlwind. That is why I am so disassociated from
simple things like celebrating Christmas. Give me time to
adjust and learn the value of things. You know that I do
not even yet fit smoothly into the rhythms of life, even here
at Monticello. I still want to alter and tear down and rebuild
and that distresses you; but I am trying, my dear&mdash;I
am sincerely trying. Ultimately I shall learn to be a quiescent
ancient, grateful for a fireside and an easy chair. And
if you wish to celebrate Christmas, by all means let us celebrate
Christmas. Shall we have a great house full of guests
and much feasting and merrymaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she lifted both hands. &ldquo;Papa, you know you
can&rsquo;t afford it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;And how are we to celebrate if we lack the
proper materials and incentive? Shall we merely hang the
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
holly high and slaughter the goose and carol a few stanzas
under the mistletoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realize, sir,&rdquo; she faced him sternly, &ldquo;that you
have not spent a Christmas day in this house since I was a
little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have kept count all these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have kept count. And so has every one at Monticello.
You owe something to Monticello in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then by all means, that is one debt that I shall pay,&rdquo;
he smiled, letting his long, thin lips relax, and his voice sink
to a caressing murmur. &ldquo;Plan it all, Daughter. Plan it all
well and then simply tell your old father what it is that you
want him to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="lr"><i>Monticello: Christmas, 1809</i></p>
</div>
<p>Of all the people on Jefferson&rsquo;s Little Mountain, old
Burwell was happiest in those lowering, chilly
December days.</p>
<p>This, the old man orated happily in the servant&rsquo;s quarters
below stairs, was the way things ought to be on a gentleman&rsquo;s
estate in Virginia. Plenty of cider cooling ready to be
sent posthaste up to the dining room, riding Mister Tom&rsquo;s
dumb-waiter. Women running up and down the steep,
narrow curving stairways at either end of the house carrying
pitchers of hot water and clean sheets, and heating irons
in the rooms below to press voluminous dresses for the
young misses. Trula, the laundress, kept a whole row of
sadirons heating on the hearth of her little brick-floored
room, and in the warming kitchens were rows of clean
scrubbed bricks heating too, ready to be wrapped in flannel
and carried upstairs should some members of the family
find the clean linen sheets too icy for their feet.</p>
<p>Mr. Jack Eppes had come riding up from Eppington,
bringing a haunch of venison that he had hung for days to
tender it, and now it was turning slowly on a great iron
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
spit, with a half-grown Negro boy sitting by with a mop
of clean lint to dip into melted fat and wine vinegar whenever
the meat needed basting. For days the service yard had
been full of squawkings and drifting feathers as the women
killed and dressed turkeys and geese. A fat ham simmered,
and plump plum puddings boiled and bubbled, with sauce
being beaten up in earthen bowls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This here now,&rdquo; stated Burwell, pompously, &ldquo;is going
to be a sure-enough Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the fine china had been taken down from the cupboards
and washed, and every wineglass on the place rubbed
to a shine. Burwell himself had polished the silver, not
trusting any other servant to that special task because Mister
Tom wanted things right when he took a fancy notion.
Right now he had the notion and had it through and
through.</p>
<p>Cayce, the new young body servant Burwell was training,
was pressing his master&rsquo;s new wool pantaloons and the
old Negro stood by, supervising and grumbling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old times in Washington,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;Mister Tom
wouldn&rsquo;t be seen in old plain long-leg breeches like them
there. Up there we got him up all dandified in white satin
knee breeches and long silk stockings and a swingy-tail coat.
Ruffles all starched.&mdash;Boy, did he strut! &lsquo;Mister President!&rsquo;
everybody say, and bow, and some ladies scrooch way
down till they petticoats lay all out on the floor. Won&rsquo;t see
no more times like that. But anyhow, we puttin&rsquo; the big pot
in the little one, this Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got Dely ironing a ruffled shirt right now,&rdquo; insisted
Cayce, &ldquo;but he say he ain&rsquo;t wearin&rsquo; no buckle shoes. They
hurt his feet. Dunno how I git them old slippers off&rsquo;n him,
but Miss Patsy say I got it to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Randolphs and Carrs and Francis Eppes, all
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
red-cheeked and excited, were running in and out of the
house, lugging in branches of cedar and pine and holly, scattering
needles and berries and trash over the shining floors
so that two women had to follow around with brooms and
mops to shine up to suit Miss Patsy. But in the library,
where a great fire burned under the mirrored mantel and
bookshelves mounted to the ceiling on every wall, Thomas
Jefferson sat in his revolving chair and looked long into the
gold and scarlet leap of the flames.</p>
<p>His thin legs were clothed in a disreputable old pair of
homemade linsey-woolsey breeches, his woolen stockings
sagging around his ankles. His daughter looked at him and
sighed, forbearing to nag at him, since he had promised to
be properly and elegantly dressed for the Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d dress up,&rdquo; she murmured to her daughter,
Ann. &ldquo;Aunt Anna will be driving in soon and whenever he
looks shabby and uncared for, Aunt Anna always looks at
me as though it were my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be,&rdquo; urged Ann. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s old, Mother, and tired
and he has earned the right to do as he pleases in his own
house. At least he is letting us have a real Christmas, so
maybe people will stop saying Thomas Jefferson is a great
man but that he is also a heathen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they say things like that, Ann?&rdquo; asked her mother
anxiously. &ldquo;Surely not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard them. So has Jeff. So I asked him straightway
this morning, &lsquo;Grandfather, do you really believe in God?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t speak at all till he had taken me by the arm
and led me over to that long window. Then he pointed at
the far mountains and there was a cloud lying on top with
a little touch of sun like gold shining over it. &lsquo;Did any man
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
make that?&rsquo; he asked me. Then he went back to his book
again and never looked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you have your answer. Daughter, a great man is
like a pillar that stands a little higher than the commonalty.
There is always an itch in the crowd of lesser humanity to
throw rocks and mud at it. It was the new laws he wrote
for Virginia that started that infidel canard. The law freed
the people of the state from being taxed to support the
Church. It left them free to worship and pay tithes where
they pleased, and naturally the bishops and other clergy
resented it. So the story was circulated that Thomas Jefferson
had no religion, and to my knowledge he has never
spoken one word to refute that libel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He disdained to answer it, Mother. He knew what he
was and what he believed and to his mind it was no concern
of any one else. He was Jefferson who belonged to the
people, but what was in his heart and mind belonged only
to himself. Now, at Monticello, he belongs to himself and
he is just learning how to live with himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martha sighed as she bent to rescue a falling pine cone
that had shattered down on the hearth. &ldquo;The children
haven&rsquo;t secured these wreaths very well,&rdquo; she remarked,
&ldquo;and that one in the drawing room is hung too low. The
fire will dry it out and it might begin to burn. I&rsquo;ll tell Burwell
to do something about it. Ever since Shadwell burned
before ever father was married, he has been uneasy about
fire. He lost all his precious books and papers then and
nothing was saved but his fiddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d play again,&rdquo; sighed Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard
him since I was very small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and my mother played together constantly,&rdquo; Martha
said. &ldquo;When you grow older memories sharpen and sometimes
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
they hurt. I doubt if he will ever play again. He made
both Polly and me learn to play in France, but after we
came home again we could never persuade him to play with
us. He said we couldn&rsquo;t keep time like Mama, but I knew
even then that he couldn&rsquo;t bear to remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was she like, Mother&mdash;your mama?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slender and lovely&mdash;and she held herself proudly. But
in the years I remember she had children too fast and she
was ill and weak a great deal of the time. And Polly inherited
her frailty and faded away so very young. I&rsquo;m glad
you are all stout and healthy,&rdquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen is letting herself get fat. She eats too many sweets
and won&rsquo;t walk ten steps if she can help it. I scold her all
the time. Ellen could be pretty, if she doesn&rsquo;t ruin her face
with too many chins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be critical of your sisters.&mdash;Ah, here&rsquo;s Aunt
Anna&rsquo;s carriage now. Do run and call Cayce and tell him to
replenish the fire in the south bedroom. Aunt Anna has
refused to climb our crooked stairs for years.&rdquo; Martha
hurried away to welcome Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s sister and led
her into the library. &ldquo;Papa, here&rsquo;s Aunt Anna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jefferson came forward, his hands outstretched. He loved
this younger sister and pulled her down into a deep chair
without giving her time to take off her bonnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toast your feet,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I know how this first
cold gets into old bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old?&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Since when did you decide to be
old, Tom Jefferson? You&rsquo;ll be hammering up things on this
hill twenty years from now.&mdash;Well, Randolph wouldn&rsquo;t
come,&rdquo; she went on in a tone of disgust. &ldquo;Only twenty
miles and he said it was too hard a trip in cold weather.
That&rsquo;s your only brother for you, Tom. How long since
you have seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two years,&rdquo; Jefferson pulled a chair up beside her. &ldquo;He
came over and brought me a cask of young carp for my
fish pond. He stayed one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Randolph said he couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; put in young
Jefferson. &ldquo;He said he was expecting every minute that his
bed would go crashing up against the ceiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom and his tinkering.&rdquo; She had a hearty laugh. &ldquo;Well,
my bed will have a stout chore to do if it hoists me to the
ceiling tonight. For Heavens&rsquo; sake, Tom, get yourself
elected governor again so we can have some decent roads
in Virginia. Even on that turnpike the mud was hub deep
and my horses traveled grunting like oxen. But if you do
get elected, Tom,&rdquo; she gave him an amiable prod with her
knuckles, &ldquo;get yourself a haircut! What&rsquo;s the matter with
Burwell? Has old age caught up with him too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll arrange to be barbered up beautifully this afternoon,&rdquo;
Jefferson assured her. &ldquo;The people have all been
busy. They are bound this shall be the most elaborate Christmas
ever celebrated in Albemarle County.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time there was some life in this house,&rdquo; she said bluntly.
&ldquo;One thing you must never do is shut yourself up here like
a hermit. He will, Patsy, unless you keep after him. He&rsquo;ll
read ten thousand books and never know his stockings are
bagging down around his ankles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; began Martha, hesitantly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a Christmas
Eve service at the church tonight. It&rsquo;s not snowing&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s only three miles. Would you go, Papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at her with a direct, searching look. &ldquo;What
are you thinking, Patsy? Though I think I can read it in
your face. You think it would have made her happy. Very
well. Order the chaise around&mdash;but, as for me, I shall ride
Eagle. I&rsquo;ll go to church with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How people will stare!&rdquo; whispered Ellen, in their
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
room as the girls dressed for supper. &ldquo;Nobody will even
look at the minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather won&rsquo;t even know they are staring,&rdquo; declared
Cornelia. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been stared at with bands playing
and soldiers standing at attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; remarked Ann, &ldquo;is as aloof and untouchable
as one of those mountains out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But people love him. Look how they swarmed over this
place all summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you noticed how low and gently he speaks lately?
Even to the servants, some of the stupidest ones, he never
raises his voice. And they scramble like anything to do
what he wants done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he knows he is great and famous. Like the
mountains. They know they are going to be there forever
and nothing can ever destroy them. Greatness, real greatness,
is always simple,&rdquo; insisted Ann.</p>
<p>There was the fragrance of evergreens and of many candles
burning in the church and a feebly burning wood fire
strove to take a bit of the chill off the place. Martha
wrapped her heavy cloak around her knees, then lifted a
fold of it and spread it over her father&rsquo;s thin legs as he sat,
stiffly upright beside her on the hard pew. There was a
silence as the minister came in, his vestment and stole very
white in the dim light. Then in the gallery high at the back
came a humming, and the slaves seated there began singing,
low at first, then higher and clearer, rich deep harmony
filling the raftered spaces above where candle smoke softly
drifted.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Who got weary? Christmas day! Christmas day!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Oh, no, Lawd! Ain&rsquo;t nobody weary. Nobody weary Christmas day!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Thomas Jefferson gripped his daughter&rsquo;s hand hard. &ldquo;She
sang that,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She liked that song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The age-old words rang out: &ldquo;And there were in the
same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch
over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord
came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round
about them; and they were sore afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martha Randolph saw her father&rsquo;s lips moving. Was he
praying? No, his eyes were not cast down and there was
no humility in the set of his shoulders. He was looking
straight ahead and upward, into the high lift of the ceiling
above the chancel where a round window framed an indigo-dark
circle of the sky. She caught the faint whisper from
his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; he was saying to some vision unseen, &ldquo;I am
here, beloved.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
